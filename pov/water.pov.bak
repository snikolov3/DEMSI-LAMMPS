// povray -W800 -N600 +A water.pov
// This will produce water.png, an 800x600 image. For faster rendering, you can reduce the resolution and not do anti-aliasing, for example:
// povray -W320 -H240 water.pov
// To really get the look you want, check out the POV ray docs: http://www.povray.org/documentation/
// It's pretty similar to OpenGL, so have fun with it!
